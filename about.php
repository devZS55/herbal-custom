						<h2>Our Story<br>
                    <b> Herbal <span>Medicine</span></b></h2>
						<p>Before the development of chemical medications, natural remedies were widely used to treat illnesses and the majority of people relied on herbal products to adopt and maintain a healthy lifestyle. However, the lack of knowledge about herbs has increased skepticism about the health benefits of these products nowadays. Understanding the need of the hour, we felt the urge to develop herbal medicines by fusing our skills and knowledge that are safe to use for every age group and every medical condition. </p>
